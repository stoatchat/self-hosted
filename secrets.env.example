# DO NOT EDIT secrets.env.example - copy it to secrets.env then edit it as
# instructed.
#
# This file is for storing secrets for your Stoat instance safely. To use the
# secrets file, copy secrets.env.example to secrets.env with the command:
# cp secrets.env.example secrets.env
# 
# Secrets must be stored in .env format, and will never be overwritten by the
# generate_config.sh script. The generate_config.sh script will first check
# secrets.env for secrets, and if a secret exists it will use that secret. If
# it does not exist, it will generate a new one and write it to secrets.env. If
# generate_config.sh creates new secrets, they will be added to the end of the
# file.
#
# You should only need to modify secrets.env manually once, then after that
# generate_config.sh will manage it. If you need to add a secret, uncomment the
# line the secret is on by removing the # and the space before the name of the
# secret and paste the secret after the equals sign, with single quote marks
# surrounding the secret. Example secrets are provided to demonstrate.
#
# This is an example secret
VALID_SECRET_EXAMPLE='example_secret'
#
# This is also an example secret
VALID_SECRET_EXAMPLE_2='This is an example secret'
